CURRENT

- Siganl-growth Cone
- T_branch - Bifurcation
- NEURON_BODY_SEED (Tropfenform)
- fooldfill around dendrites or Pointsize *3

GROWTH

- oder of growth: axon an apical first than basal

- T-Branch only two / more than one branch at one branchpoint/cell?

- use z for color fading (fog)

- pos neurons to vec3

- forward as float vector

- add neuron type to create gene.

- after growth propagate signals back and kill dead branch

- maybe : add neuron body gene and growth.

- new glMatrix with require

VISUALISATION

- neuron bodies become bigger with MP, cell in general become bigger with
- Signal are larger than normal cells.
- path length histogram
- signals graph


DONE

- cell type names in CONST used in Stats
- transformation of celltype
- max signals
- hold counter in signal
- Shader Code in separate file
- branches: fork, t-branch-3, t-branch-2, parent angle change
